Smallest array 


Finding the Smallest Element in an Array

The following algorithm finds the smallest element in a given array:

Initialize a variable smallest with the first element of the array.

Iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).

Compare each element with smallest.

If the current element is smaller than smallest, update smallest with the current element.

After the loop ends, the variable smallest will contain the smallest number in the array
